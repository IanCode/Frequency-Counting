# Word Counting with a Hash Table

This program counts the words inside of a text file using a hash table. 

### Description

This project contains three separate classes. HashTable and HashElem must be used together, and can be used as general structures for any kind of program that requires a hash table. The WordFreqs program is an interactive program that uses the HashTable class.

### Usage

To compile:
```
javac HashTable.java HashElem.java WordFreqs.java`
```

To run:
```
java WordFreqs [name of text file]
```

Type a "-" before a word to delete it.
i.e.
```
-france 
"france" has been deleted.
```
